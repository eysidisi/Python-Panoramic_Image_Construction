SUMMARY
This project is prepared for BBM-418 Computer Vision Laboratory Assignment-2.  An implementation of Panoramic photography technique was done and results are given for this assignment.  Sample space consists of images which are parts of a panoramic image.Python was used as programming language and OpenCV was used for processing library.  Results show that we were partially able to form panoramic images with some errors and missing parts. 

HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
To run this project you need to have numpy and opencv packages on your computer. After installing packages follow the given steps in order.

1)Open "main.py" folder.
2) Open "Utils.py" folder.
3) Set "img_dir" and "result_dir" variables to where you keep input images and store the resultant images respectively. 
(
 For example     img_dir = r"C:\Users\AliIhsan\Desktop\Assignment_2\pano9"
    		result_dir = r"C:\Users\AliIhsan\Desktop\Assignment_2\Results"

)
4) Save and close "main.py" folder.
5) Open command prompt or Anaconda Prompt and navigate to "code" folder
6) Type 'python main.py" and hit enter.
7) You start seeing logs if it's working
